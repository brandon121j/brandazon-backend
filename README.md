<h1>brandazon-backend</h1>
<p>Brandazon is a Amazon inspired e-commerce website that I created using the MERN stack. Some features that I implemented into this application are Register/Login functionality, responsive web interface, frontend/backend validators, as well as the use of cookies to store user data in the backend.</p>
